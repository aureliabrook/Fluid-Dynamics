#### Instructions
###### (As required by the assignment)
Instructions for running this code are fairly simple. Since it's in a python notebook, open it and run all cells. All graphs, tables, and images will be saved to wherever the ipynb file is also located. If someone wanted to change the N and dt parameters for the text files that generate a solution to the streetwise velocity PDE, simply change currN and curr_dt at the top of the notebook (cell 3).
